### [NLPAR](/NLPAR.py)
This project is Natural Language Processing Project concerned with Arabic Language. With the use of nltk, re and pyarabic libraries, I made Arabic Tokenizer, Stemmer and POS Tagger. The Stemmer is based on this [paper](http://aircconline.com/ijdkp/V4N6/4614ijdkp01.pdf), the accuracy of getting correct POS Tag is about 85%. This project was made for **(NLP - Forth Year)** in my college.

### [GUI](/GUI.py)
This part is a training to use tkinter library to build simple GUI with python, you enter a word then click (Get Tag) to get the POS Tag of the arabic word.
